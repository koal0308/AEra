# AEra Token – The Resonant Standard

**Version 1.0** | **November 2025**

**Network:** Ethereum (Sepolia → Mainnet)  
**Symbol:** AERA | **Type:** ERC-20 (Standard + Permit + Pausable + Burnable)

---

## 1 | Vision

AEra is a technological and ethical experiment built around **resonance – the alignment between human intent and transparent digital systems**.

The goal is not speculation, but **trust through verifiability**: a token that exists only to connect participants who build, test and audit open infrastructure together.

AEra represents a unit of contribution – not ownership, not promise, but **proof of participation** in an evolving open-source ecosystem that merges engineering precision with human depth.

## 2 | Core Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Transparency** | Code first – all contracts are verifiable, open-source, and reproducible. |
| **Resonance** | Value emerges from alignment and clarity, not from hype or scarcity. |
| **Accountability** | Every function is auditable; every decision traceable on-chain. |
| **Autonomy** | No hidden backdoors, no external dependencies, full open-license architecture. |
| **Community Safety** | Multi-sig ownership, emergency-pause mechanisms, and open audit logs. |

## 3 | Technical Overview

| Field | Specification |
|-------|---------------|
| **Contract Name** | `AeraToken` |
| **Symbol** | `AERA` |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Initial Supply** | 100 million AERA |
| **Maximum Supply** | 1 billion AERA |
| **Compiler** | Solidity 0.8.20 (paris EVM version) |
| **Features** | `ERC20 + Burnable + Permit (EIP-2612) + Pausable + Ownable` |
| **Owner Structure** | Gnosis Safe (2-of-3 Multi-Sig on Sepolia → Mainnet migration) |
| **License** | MIT Open Source |

---

## 4 | Governance Model

AEra is designed for **collective stewardship**, not corporate control.

- **Ownership:** Transferred to a multi-signature Safe before public release.
- **Voting / Signaling:** Future DAO modules (planned) will use snapshot-style off-chain signaling only – no binding on-chain finance without legal review.
- **Upgrades:** Immutable core; future modules deployed separately and linked via interfaces.
- **Emergency Controls:** Pause / Unpause / Mint accessible only through Safe signatures.

## 5 | Distribution & Airdrop Policy

AEra does **not** conduct any sale, ICO, IDO, or fundraising activity.
All tokens circulating on testnets or in community drops are **test allocations** used to verify technical and social integrity.

### Airdrop Guidelines (Transparency Commitments)

1. **Network:** Sepolia Testnet (Phase I), Ethereum Mainnet (Phase II – post-audit).
2. **Distribution Cap:** ≤ 50 AERA per wallet during testing.
3. **Eligibility:** Wallets that verify through signature and consent only (EIP-4361 Sign-in with Ethereum).
4. **Data Policy:** No emails / personal data stored. Only hashed wallet IDs + Tx logs.
5. **Purpose:** Community testing of resonance-based governance and AI-integration tools.
6. **Legal Status:** AERA is not a financial instrument, security, or investment contract.

## 6 | Use Cases

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Verification Layer** | Access key for participation in the VERA / PAXIS ecosystem nodes. |
| **Reputation Marker** | Proof of authentic contribution to ethical AI and open innovation. |
| **Resonance Metrics** | Enables transparent tracking of collective alignment between humans and AI. |
| **Access Token** | Grants non-financial access to research forums, AI sandboxes, and open audits. |

---

## 7 | Security Architecture

1. **Multi-Sig Safe:** All admin functions require ≥ 2 signatures.
2. **Pausable Mechanism:** Immediate stop of transfers in case of security concerns.
3. **Emergency Withdraw:** Recover ETH / Tokens sent by mistake.
4. **Audit Tools:** Static analysis (Slither), runtime testing (Hardhat/Foundry).
5. **Bug Bounty Program:** Open after Mainnet launch (Q2 2026).

## 11 | Closing Statement

AEra is not a promise of value – it is an invitation to verify value yourself.
In a world flooded with claims, AEra builds clarity.
Every line of code is a contract of transparency; every signature a pulse of resonance.

**The future of trust is open – and AEra is its first tone.**
